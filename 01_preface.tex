\section*{Preface}
As a prestudy for my masters thesis this project work is presented as final deliverable in the subject "TBA4510 - Geotechnical Engineering, Specialization Project" at the Department of Civil and Transport Engineering, NTNU during the spring semester of 2021. 
The course is 7.5 SP credits.

The project was suggested and superviced by Yutao Pan, NTNU.
\\
Here, you give a brief introduction to your work. What it is (e.g., a Project thesis in geotechnics at NTNU as part of the MSc in Civil and Environmental Engineering or Geotechnics and Geohazards), when it was carried out (e.g., during the autumn semester of 2013). If the project has been carried out for a company, you should mention this and also describe the cooperation with the company. You may also describe how the idea to the project was brought up.\\[2cm]
